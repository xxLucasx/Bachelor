abstract = {Many regulated organisations are now starting to activate a second wave of Identity and Access Management (IAM) initiatives as they attempt to rectify the mistakes made in the first attempt. Organisations are starting on a second wave of Identity and Access Management (IAM) projects as they attempt to rectify the mistakes made the first time round. Cath Everett explores what went wrong and why focusing on processes, governance and people rather than technology is the only way to create sustainable and secure ways of working. She also looks at what the future is likely to hold and what we can expect to see in the third wave.}
