abstract = {Many regulated organisations are now starting to activate a second wave of Identity and Access Management (IAM) initiatives as they attempt to rectify the mistakes made in the first attempt. Organisations are starting on a second wave of Identity and Access Management (IAM) projects as they attempt to rectify the mistakes made the first time round. Cath Everett explores what went wrong and why focusing on processes, governance and people rather than technology is the only way to create sustainable and secure ways of working. She also looks at what the future is likely to hold and what we can expect to see in the third wave.}

abstract = {If you had to buy just one text on algorithms, Introduction to Algorithms is a magnificent choice. The book begins by considering the mathematical foundations of the analysis of algorithms and maintains this mathematical rigor throughout the work. The tools developed in these opening sections are then applied to sorting, data structures, graphs, and a variety of selected algorithms including computational geometry, string algorithms, parallel models of computation, fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), and more. This book's strength lies in its encyclopedic range, clear exposition, and powerful analysis. Pseudo-code explanation of the algorithms coupled with proof of their accuracy makes this book is a great resource on the basic tools used to analyze the performance of algorithms.}
